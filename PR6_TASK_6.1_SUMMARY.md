# PR #6 - Task 6.1: Setup Firestore Listener ✅

## Summary
Successfully enhanced the Firestore real-time synchronization system to handle granular document changes (added/modified/removed) for multi-user collaboration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Canvas Service (`canvas.service.ts`)
- **Added `ShapeChangeEvent` interface** for typed change events
- **Enhanced `subscribeToShapes()` function**:
  - Now uses `snapshot.docChanges()` to detect specific change types
  - Returns granular change events instead of replacing entire shape array
  - Logs specific change types: `added`, `modified`, `removed`
  - Only triggers callback when there are actual changes (performance optimization)

### 2. Updated useCanvas Hook (`useCanvas.ts`)
- **Added `applyShapeChanges()` method**:
  - Handles incremental shape updates
  - Adds new shapes (prevents duplicates)
  - Updates modified shapes
  - Removes deleted shapes
  - Clears selection when deleted shape was selected
- **Improved state management**: Incremental updates instead of full replacement

### 3. Updated Canvas Component (`Canvas.tsx`)
- **Two-phase loading strategy**:
  - **Phase 1**: Initial load using `fetchAllShapes()` - loads all existing shapes at once
  - **Phase 2**: Real-time sync using `subscribeToShapes()` - handles incremental changes
- **Skip initial snapshot**: Avoids duplicate loading (shapes already fetched in Phase 1)
- **Better performance**: Only updates changed shapes, not entire array

### 4. Updated Unit Tests (`canvas.service.test.ts`)
- **Enhanced `subscribeToShapes` tests**:
  - Test `added` event type
  - Test `modified` event type
  - Test `removed` event type
  - Test no callback when no changes
- **Total test coverage**: 18 tests for canvas service (all passing ✅)

### 5. Fixed Integration Tests
- Updated `Canvas.test.tsx` and `auth-flow.test.tsx` with proper mocks
- All 106 tests passing ✅

## Technical Implementation

### Before (PR #5):
```typescript
subscribeToShapes((shapes: CanvasShape[]) => {
  setShapes(shapes); // Replace entire array
});
```

### After (PR #6, Task 6.1):
```typescript
// Initial load
fetchAllShapes().then(setShapes);

// Incremental updates
subscribeToShapes((changes: ShapeChangeEvent[]) => {
  applyShapeChanges(changes); // Apply only changed shapes
});
```

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Only updates changed shapes, not entire canvas
2. **Clarity**: Explicit handling of added/modified/removed events
3. **Scalability**: Efficient with large numbers of shapes
4. **Debugging**: Clear console logs for each change type
5. **No Duplicates**: Prevents duplicate shapes from initial snapshot

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/services/canvas.service.ts`
2. ✅ `src/hooks/useCanvas.ts`
3. ✅ `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`
4. ✅ `src/services/canvas.service.test.ts`
5. ✅ `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.test.tsx`
6. ✅ `src/__tests__/integration/auth-flow.test.tsx`

## Test Results

```
✅ Test Files: 13 passed (13)
✅ Tests: 106 passed (106)
```

### New Tests Added:
- `should subscribe to real-time shape updates with change detection`
- `should handle modified shape updates`
- `should handle removed shape updates`
- `should not call callback when there are no changes`

## Next Steps (Task 6.2)

Now that the Firestore listener properly detects change types, the next task is to verify real-time shape creation across multiple users.

**Task 6.2**: Handle Real-Time Shape Creation
- Verify shapes created by one user appear instantly for other users (<100ms)
- Prevent duplicate rendering
- Test with 2+ browser windows
