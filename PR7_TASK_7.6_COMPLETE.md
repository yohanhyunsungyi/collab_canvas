# PR #7 - Task 7.6: Manual Testing - COMPLETE ✅

**Completed:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **PASSED** - All functionality verified

---

## ✅ Test Results

**Overall Result:** PASS ✅

**User Verification:**
- Manual testing completed with 2 browser windows
- All core locking functionality working correctly
- Visual indicators displaying properly
- No console errors during testing
- Lock acquisition and release working as expected

---

## 🎯 What Was Verified

### ✅ Lock Acquisition
- First user can lock shapes by clicking/dragging
- Lock acquired instantly on interaction
- Teal outline shows when you have the lock

### ✅ Lock Blocking
- Second user blocked from interacting with locked shapes
- Red outline shows when shape is locked by another user
- Cannot drag or resize locked shapes
- Clear visual feedback

### ✅ Lock Release
- Locks release automatically after drag ends
- Locks release automatically after transform ends
- Shape becomes available for other users immediately

### ✅ Visual Indicators
- Teal outline (#00bcd4) for your locked shapes
- Red outline (#ff5722) for others' locked shapes
- 70% opacity for locked shapes
- No flickering or visual glitches

### ✅ Real-Time Sync
- Lock status updates propagate to all users
- Visual changes appear quickly (<1-2 seconds)
- Multiple browser windows sync correctly

## 📊 Progress Update

**PR #7 Status: 6/8 tasks complete (75%)**

### Completed Tasks ✅
1. Task 7.1: Lock fields in schema ✅
2. Task 7.2: Lock acquisition ✅
3. Task 7.3: Lock release ✅
4. Task 7.4: Visual indicators ✅
5. Task 7.5: Interaction blocking ✅
6. Task 7.6: Manual testing ✅ **← Just completed!**

### Remaining Tasks ⏳
7. Task 7.7: Unit tests for locking logic
8. Task 7.8: Integration tests for multi-user scenarios

---

## 🎉 Summary

The object locking system has been **successfully validated** through manual testing with multiple browser windows. All core functionality works as designed:

- ✅ Prevents race conditions when multiple users interact with same object
- ✅ Clear visual feedback (teal vs red outlines)
- ✅ Automatic lock acquisition and release
- ✅ Smooth user experience with no errors

**Next:** Write automated tests to ensure this functionality remains stable (Tasks 7.7 & 7.8).

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue with Automated Tests
- **Task 7.7:** Write unit tests (~30-45 minutes)
- **Task 7.8:** Write integration tests (~45-60 minutes)
- **Total:** ~1.5-2 hours for complete test coverage

### Option 2: Move to PR #8
- Skip automated tests for now (can add later)
- Start PR #8: Multiplayer Cursors
- Come back to tests later if needed

### Option 3: Merge PR #7
- Current implementation is solid and tested
- 139/139 existing tests passing
- Manual testing verified
- Ready for production use

---

## 💡 Recommendation

**Continue with Tasks 7.7 & 7.8** (Option 1)

**Why:**
- Ensures locking logic is fully tested
- Prevents regressions in future changes
- Provides confidence for production deployment
- Takes ~1.5-2 hours total
- Good practice for production-quality code

**Automated tests will verify:**
- Lock acquisition in all scenarios
- Lock release in all scenarios
- Lock timeout mechanism
- Concurrent access handling
- Edge cases and error conditions
