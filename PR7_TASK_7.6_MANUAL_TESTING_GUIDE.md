# PR #7 - Task 7.6: Manual Testing Guide for Object Locking

**Time Required:** 15-20 minutes  
**Goal:** Verify object locking works correctly with multiple users

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Server should start at: `http://localhost:5173`

### 2. Open Test Windows

**Option A: Multiple Browsers**
- Window 1: Chrome (normal)
- Window 2: Firefox or Safari

**Option B: Incognito Windows**
- Window 1: Chrome (normal)
- Window 2: Chrome (Incognito) - Cmd+Shift+N

**Option C: Chrome Profiles** (Recommended)
- Window 1: Regular profile
- Window 2: Guest/Incognito mode

### 3. Create Test Accounts (if needed)

If you don't have test accounts:
- testuser1@example.com / password123
- testuser2@example.com / password123

Sign up through the UI if they don't exist yet.

## ‚úÖ Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Lock Acquisition ‚≠ê MOST IMPORTANT

**Setup:**
1. Window 1: Sign in as User A
2. Window 2: Sign in as User B
3. Create a rectangle in Window 1

**Test Steps:**
1. **Window 1:** Click and hold the rectangle (mousedown, don't release)
   - Expected: Rectangle shows **teal outline** (you have lock)
   
2. **Window 2:** Try to click the same rectangle
   - Expected: Rectangle shows **red outline** (locked by other user)
   - Expected: Cannot drag (shape doesn't move)
   - Expected: Console log: "Cannot interact - shape is locked by [userId]"

3. **Window 1:** Release mouse (mouseup)
   - Expected: Rectangle returns to normal (no outline)

4. **Window 2:** Now try to click the rectangle again
   - Expected: Can now interact with it ‚úÖ
   - Expected: Shows teal outline when you grab it

**‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] User A can lock shape by clicking
- [ ] User B sees red outline on locked shape
- [ ] User B cannot drag locked shape
- [ ] Lock releases when User A releases mouse

---

### Scenario 2: Lock During Drag

**Test Steps:**

   - Expected: Teal outline, shape is dragging
   
2. **Window 2:** While Window 1 is still dragging, try to click same shape
   - Expected: Red outline, cannot interact
   
3. **Window 1:** Complete the drag (release mouse)

   - Expected: Can now drag it ‚úÖ

**‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Lock acquired on drag start
- [ ] Other user blocked during drag

- [ ] Position updates sync correctly

---

### Scenario 3: Lock During Resize/Transform

**Test Steps:**

   - Expected: Teal outline + resize handles appear

2. **Window 1:** Click and drag a resize handle (start resizing)
   - Expected: Shape is resizing

3. **Window 2:** Try to click the same shape while it's being resized
   - Expected: Red outline, cannot interact

4. **Window 1:** Release resize handle (complete transform)
   - Expected: New size saved
   - Expected: Lock released

5. **Window 2:** Try to select and resize the shape

---

### Scenario 4: Lock Timeout (30 seconds) ‚è±Ô∏è

**Test Steps:**
1. **Window 1:** Click and hold a shape
   - Expected: Shape locked (teal outline)

2. **Window 1:** Close the browser tab/window (simulate crash)
   - Shape remains locked in Firestore

3. **Window 2:** Try to interact with the shape immediately
   - Expected: Red outline, cannot interact (still locked)

4. **Wait 30 seconds** ‚è∞

5. **Window 2:** Try to interact with the shape again
   - Expected: Can now interact (lock expired) ‚úÖ

**‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Lock persists after user disconnects
- [ ] Lock blocks interaction for <30 seconds
- [ ] Lock expires after 30 seconds
- [ ] New user can acquire expired lock

---

### Scenario 5: Rapid Concurrent Clicks (Race Condition)

**Test Steps:**
1. **Setup:** Both windows open, viewing same shape

2. **Both users:** Click the same shape at EXACTLY the same time
   - Expected: One user gets lock (teal), other sees red
   - Expected: No errors in console
   - Expected: Only one lock exists in Firestore

3. Verify which user "won" the race

   - Loser: Cannot drag, sees red outline

**‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Only one user gets lock (first-write-wins)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] No duplicate locks

2. **Window 1:** Click and hold the shape
   - **Window 2 Expected:** Shape changes to red outline in <1 second
   
3. **Window 1:** Release the shape
   - **Window 2 Expected:** Red outline disappears in <1 second

4. Verify real-time sync is working

**‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Lock status updates appear quickly (<1-2 seconds)
- [ ] Red outline appears when locked by other user
- [ ] Red outline disappears when lock released
- [ ] No flickering or visual glitches

## üîç What to Look For

### Console Logs

**Good logs (expected):**
```
[Canvas Service] Lock acquired on shape shape-123 by user-abc
[Canvas] Lock acquired on shape shape-123
[Shape] Cannot interact - shape shape-123 is locked by user-abc
[Canvas Service] Lock released on shape shape-123
[Canvas] Lock released on shape shape-123
```

**Bad logs (problems):**
```
‚ùå Error: Failed to acquire lock
‚ùå Error: Failed to release lock
‚ùå Permission denied (Firestore rules issue)
‚ùå Uncaught exception
```

### Visual Feedback

**Correct visuals:**
- ‚úÖ Teal outline (#00bcd4) = You have the lock
- ‚úÖ Red outline (#ff5722) = Someone else has the lock
- ‚úÖ No outline = Shape is available
- ‚úÖ 70% opacity when locked by others

**Incorrect visuals:**
- ‚ùå No outline on locked shapes
- ‚ùå Wrong colors
- ‚ùå Flickering outlines
- ‚ùå Shapes disappearing

### Interaction Behavior

**Correct behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Locked shapes don't drag when clicked
- ‚úÖ Transformer doesn't attach to locked shapes
- ‚úÖ Cursor changes on locked shapes
- ‚úÖ Smooth lock acquisition/release

**Incorrect behavior:**
- ‚ùå Can drag locked shapes
- ‚ùå Multiple users can drag same shape
- ‚ùå Locks don't release
- ‚ùå Locks release too early

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Lock doesn't release after drag

**Symptoms:** Shape stays locked (red) forever

**Possible causes:**
- dragEnd handler not firing
- Lock release function not called
- Firestore write failed

**Debug:**
1. Check console for error messages
2. Open Firestore console, check `canvasObjects` collection
3. Manually set `lockedBy: null` and `lockedAt: null`

---

### Issue 2: Both users can drag same shape

**Symptoms:** No locking behavior at all

**Possible causes:**
- Lock handlers not connected
- Real-time sync not working
- Lock check bypassed

**Debug:**
1. Check console for lock acquisition logs
2. Verify Firestore rules allow writes
3. Check network tab for Firestore requests

---

### Issue 3: Lock timeout not working

**Symptoms:** Lock never expires after 30 seconds

**Possible causes:**
- `isLockExpired()` not called
- Timeout constant wrong
- Time comparison logic error

**Debug:**
1. Check current time: `Date.now()`
2. Check `lockedAt` timestamp in Firestore
3. Calculate difference: `Date.now() - lockedAt`
4. Should be > 30000 (30 seconds in ms)

---

### Issue 4: Visual indicators not showing

**Symptoms:** No red outline on locked shapes

**Possible causes:**
- CSS not applied
- `isLockedByOther` logic wrong
- Real-time updates not propagating

**Debug:**
1. Check shape props in React DevTools
2. Verify `lockedBy` and `currentUserId` values
3. Check `isLockedByOther` calculation

---

1. Document issues clearly
2. Report to developer
3. Fix issues before proceeding

---

## üí° Tips

1. **Open Console:** Keep browser console open (F12) to see logs
