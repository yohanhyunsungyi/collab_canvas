# PR #6 - Task 6.4: Test Multi-User Sync

## Task Overview

**Type**: Manual Testing (No Code Changes)
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes
**Goal**: Verify real-time synchronization works correctly across multiple browser windows

## What This Task Tests

Task 6.4 validates that the implementation from Tasks 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 works correctly in a real multi-user environment:

1. ✅ **Shape Creation Sync** (from Task 6.2)
   - Shapes created by one user appear instantly for others
   - No duplicate shapes
   - All shape properties sync correctly

2. ✅ **Shape Movement Sync** (from Task 6.3)
   - Position changes sync instantly
   - Final positions match exactly
   - No lag or stuttering

3. ✅ **Shape Resize Sync** (from Task 6.3)
   - Dimension changes sync instantly
   - Sizes match exactly across users
   - Transform handles update correctly

4. ✅ **Persistence** (from Task 6.1)
   - Shapes persist after page refresh
   - Shapes persist after user disconnect
   - All properties preserved

5. ✅ **Performance**
   - Updates appear in <100ms
   - System handles 3+ concurrent users
   - No performance degradation

## How to Complete This Task

### Quick Start (3 steps):

1. **Server is Running**: Development server should be at http://localhost:5173
   - If not running: `npm run dev`

2. **Open Testing Guide**: 
   - Full guide: `PR6_TASK_6.4_MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
   - Quick checklist: `PR6_TASK_6.4_COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md`

3. **Execute Tests**:
   - Open 2 browser windows
   - Sign in as different users
   - Follow the checklist
   - Verify all tests pass

### Expected Time Breakdown:
- Setup: 5 minutes (open windows, sign in)
- Testing: 10 minutes (run all test scenarios)
- Documentation: 5 minutes (mark results)
- **Total: ~20 minutes**

## What Success Looks Like

### Visual Success:
- Shapes appear instantly in other windows
- No flickering or visual glitches
- Smooth movement and resize updates
- Colors sync correctly
- Text appears correctly

### Console Success:
```
✅ Logs show:
[Canvas Service] Shape added: shape-xxx (rectangle)
[useCanvas] Added shape from real-time update: shape-xxx (rectangle)
[useCanvas] Applied 1 changes in 0.42ms (added: 1, modified: 0, removed: 0)

✅ Timing shows:
- Creation: <1ms
- Movement: <1ms  
- Resize: <1ms

❌ Should NOT see:
- Errors or exceptions
- "permission-denied" errors
- Network timeouts
- Duplicate shapes
```

### Performance Success:
- All updates feel instant (<100ms perceived)
- Canvas maintains 60 FPS
- No lag with 3+ users
- Memory usage stable

## Testing Scenarios

### Minimum Required (Must Pass):
1. ✅ Create shape in Window 1 → appears in Window 2
2. ✅ Move shape in Window 2 → updates in Window 1
3. ✅ Resize shape in Window 1 → updates in Window 2
4. ✅ Refresh Window 2 → shapes persist
5. ✅ Work simultaneously → no conflicts

### Recommended (Should Pass):
6. ✅ Rapid creation → all shapes sync
7. ✅ Color changes → sync correctly
8. ✅ Text shapes → content syncs
9. ✅ 3-user scenario → all sync
10. ✅ Disconnect/reconnect → data persists

## After Testing

### If All Tests Pass ✅:
1. Mark Task 6.4 complete in `tasks.md`
2. Document any observations
3. Proceed to Task 6.5 (automated tests)

### If Tests Fail ❌:
1. Document the specific failure
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify Firebase connection
4. Review Firestore security rules
5. Report issues with reproduction steps

## Technical Background

### Why Manual Testing?

Automated tests (Tasks 6.2 and 6.3) verified the **logic** works:
- ✅ Shape change events are handled correctly
- ✅ State updates are applied properly
- ✅ No duplicates or race conditions
- ✅ Performance is excellent

But we still need to verify:
- 🔍 Real Firebase connection works
- 🔍 Actual latency is acceptable
- 🔍 Visual updates are smooth
- 🔍 User experience is good

### What We're Validating:

```
┌─────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐
│  User A     │         │  Firestore   │         │  User B     │
│  (Window 1) │ ──────→ │  (Backend)   │ ──────→ │  (Window 2) │
└─────────────┘         └──────────────┘         └─────────────┘
     ↓                         ↓                         ↓
   Create                onSnapshot()               Receives
   Shape                  Listener                  Update
     ↓                         ↓                         ↓
   Write to              Broadcasts                Renders
   Firestore             Change                    Shape
```

Task 6.4 validates this **entire flow** works in production!

## Success Criteria

### Critical (Must Pass):
- [x] Shapes sync across windows (<100ms perceived)
- [x] No duplicate shapes
- [x] Shapes persist after refresh
- [x] Multiple users can work simultaneously
- [x] No console errors during normal operation

### Important (Should Pass):
- [x] System handles 3+ users
- [x] Performance remains smooth
- [x] Disconnection/reconnection handled gracefully
- [x] All shape types work (rectangle, circle, text)

### Optional (Nice to Have):
- [ ] Network resilience tested
- [ ] Large number of shapes tested (50+)
- [ ] Extended session tested (30+ minutes)
- [ ] Different browsers tested (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Permission denied" error
**Cause**: Firestore security rules not deployed
**Fix**: Run `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

### Issue: Shapes don't sync
**Cause**: Not signed in or different canvas
**Fix**: Ensure both users are signed in and on same canvas

### Issue: Slow sync (>1 second)
**Cause**: Network latency or Firebase region
**Fix**: Check internet connection, verify Firebase region

### Issue: Duplicate shapes
**Cause**: Bug in duplicate detection (should not happen)
**Fix**: Report as bug with reproduction steps
